Exercise 1: Image Processing
# pokedex

Course: Udemy - The Complete Python Developer
School: Zero To Mastery (ZTM)

This fun little project aims to learn how to use the Pillow image module (an image processing function). The goal is to create a python script that converts the JPG files in the Pokedex folder into PNG files and store them in the New folder.

My script is the JPGtoPNGConverter_Attempt.py and the solution is the JPGtoPNGConverter_Solution.py

images.py and images2.py are short scripts to play around with the Pillow image module and gain an understanding of how it works.
